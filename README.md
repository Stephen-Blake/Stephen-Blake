Hey, I’m @Stephen-Blake! And welcome to my ~~Crib~~ GitHub profile!

I'm what you would call a self-professed nerd, finding joy in all things computing, collecting, and, naturally, coding — the three C's that define my life!

I'm a programmer | developer with 16+ years of professional experience (even higher if I forget to update!). I've been immersed in the industry for the past decade, armed to the teeth with both a degree and a diploma, boasting a solid work experience of 12+ years.

When it comes to coding, I keep it simple: make it fun and enjoyable. Staying in know with the latest trends isn't just a habit, it's a hobby. While JavaScript (TypeScript), PHP, and Python are my mainstays, I'm adaptable to most languages. To me, these languages provide the best syntax, practices, and paradigms to transition to other languages with ease.
I'm very passionate about diving deep into the things I love, coding included. Whether it's mastering design patterns, data structures, algorithms, language updates, or embracing the latest tech stacks and coding practices.

My portfolio is brimming with past projects ranging from apps, bots, APIs, CRMs, and e-commerce systems to an array of website features, gadgets, and designs (creating 500+ websites alone!). I also handle project management, design, data manipulation (including CSVs), leadership, marketing, and business development!

I'll be updating my GitHub with some of my larger projects. I also have a catalog of created snippets and helpers offline. You can find some of my smaller items stored on my CodePen: [https://codepen.io/StephenMB](https://codepen.io/StephenMB).

If you need to get in touch, feel free to shoot me an email at: Hello@stephenblake.co.uk. 
I'm always up for a collaboration or even a good chat! <3

*They say it takes 10,000 hours to master something. Well, I've surpassed that threshold and I'm on the next level*
